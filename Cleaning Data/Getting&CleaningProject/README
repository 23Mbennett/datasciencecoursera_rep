##Getting and Cleaning Project README##

The R script, "run_analysis.R", does the following:
Download the dataset
Loads activity and feature data
Loads both the training and test datasets, keeping columns with either mean or standard deviation 
Loads the activity and subject data for each dataset and merges those columns with the dataset
Merges the two datasets "training data" & "test data"
Converts the activity and feature columns into factors
Creates a tidy dataset that consists of the average (mean) value of each variable for each feature and activity
The end result is shown in the file tidy.txt
